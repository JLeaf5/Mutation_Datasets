Data for paper "Rapid screening of multi-point mutations for enzyme thermostability modification by utilizing computational tools" 
1. mutation-level benchmark datasets:
  SP/DP/MP.xlsx: mutation-level independent benchmark datasets with single-point/double-point/multi-point mutations.
2. enzyme-only datasets:
  SP_eny/DP_eny/MP_eny.xlsx: mutation datasets extracted from SP/DP/MP that only contain mutations of enzymes.
3. protein-level benchmark datasets:
  Protein_30.xlsx: protein_level independent benchmark dataset that contains mutations that are less than 30% similar to the sequences of proteins used to train MAESTRO, MynaMut2 and DDMut. 
4. IsPETase and LCC:
  IsPETase/LCC.xlsx: mutations of two plastic-degrading enzymes, IsPETase and LCC.
